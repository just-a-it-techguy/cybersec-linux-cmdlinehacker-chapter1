## Linux Pre face -Instalation 
This is for the beggining to install kalli linux  and add to virtual box  as this provides a safe space to allow creation of virtual machines that are isolated form Windows / Mac /Linux  Host systems 
this adds value as it allows course to be followed and also ensures that virtual pcs are in place to work with the system as well as protect the host form accidental Data loss , as well as allow filming of items and Exersizes 
to be recoreded in Real time . To install the Kally Virtual box applicence 
go to kali linux website

> [!TIP]
> The Blue Icon  is the manfest file this tells virtual box how big the machine is to be what parmiters ar been used CPU , Ram , IO ,Hdd location 
> <br>
> the red is the actual file that runs as a Virtual Hdd volume that will carry out the machine opperations and act as the isolated system , all command will be processed and parsed and run 
<br>
to launch the vm double click on the blue manafest file  that was extracted form the kalivm down load zip file that was extracted . 
<br>
this will Launch Virtual box as by default .vbox files are associated by the Host Machine  as open with virtual box  if you are running on another hyper visor or other mehtord results may vary and
are out side the scope of this walk through. 

> [!Caution]
> the virtual machine will be created by the blue manafest and will also have the red file associated with the Virtual machine in virtual box if the file is deleted then the virtual machine is Gone.<br>
abd will delete the machine from the
